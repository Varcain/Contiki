Some notes about this directory:

Since TI uses very restrictive license for majority of Stellarisware/Tivaware
contents it's not possible to have it all on a public git repository. Recently
some parts were changed to BSD-like license from TI, most notably whole
driverlib and inc directories. Even though I could include that code into this
repository I am leaving it out for now. At some point I might include driverlib,
inc and some set of GPL'ed files (like linker script, startup code). For now this
will do.
